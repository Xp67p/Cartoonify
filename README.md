Cartoonify Image with OpenCV

This Python project uses OpenCV to convert an image into a cartoon-like representation, using grayscale conversion, edge detection, and bilateral filtering, to achieve the cartoon effect.


Features:
Converts input images into cartoon-style images

Smooths colors while preserving edges using a bilateral filter

Detects and enhances edges using adaptive thresholding
